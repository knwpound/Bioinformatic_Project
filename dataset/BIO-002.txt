Recent studies have shown that the BRCA1 gene plays a critical role in DNA repair mechanisms. Mutations in BRCA1 can lead to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Additionally, the protein p53, encoded by the TP53 gene, is crucial for regulating the cell cycle and preventing tumor formation. Researchers are also investigating the function of the EGFR protein, which is involved in the signaling pathways that control cell division. The KRAS gene, when mutated, can contribute to the development of various cancers, including pancreatic cancer.‚Äù
