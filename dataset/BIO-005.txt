Recent advancements in cancer research have highlighted the significance of the BRCA1 gene, which is crucial for repairing DNA breaks. Mutations in BRCA1 can lead to an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Similarly, the TP53 gene encodes the p53 protein, a key regulator of the cell cycle and a critical player in preventing tumor formation.

Researchers are also focusing on the ATM technology in healthcare settings to enhance patient access to medical services. 

Moreover, the KRAS gene, when mutated, is associated with various cancers, including colorectal and pancreatic cancer. Recent studies suggest that targeting the EGFR protein, involved in cell signaling pathways, could offer new therapeutic options for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
